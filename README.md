# ReadMe Generator

## Description

The purpose of this project is for a user to be able to generate a professional ReadMe by running the javascript.  When node index.js is entered into the terminal the user is asked a series of prompts about the project including: Title, Description, contributing, Installation, Usage, License, Tests and Questions.  From there the user's ReadMe is generated with the personalized inputs they had put in.


## Functions
This project highlighted what we had learned recently in bootcamp about node.js.  This included having to install the npm's (inquirer) and using the built-in function fs to write the ReadMe file.  It also required importing the function generateMarkdown() into the index.js file.
